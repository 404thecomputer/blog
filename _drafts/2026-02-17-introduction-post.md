Making this blog was a fun exercise! It was a lot smoother than I thought it was going to be, as it was easy to go step-by-step to set it up like so:

- Make a fork of the [minima repo][repo]
- Clone it onto your device
- Install Ruby and Jekyll
- Install library bundle
- Set up a local server to host the blog
- Personalize using the files in the repo

I had no experience with Jekyll so a lot of this was new to me. The most difficult part was waiting for everything to be installed and hoping that I got everything right. At one point when I was getting the libraries installed, I think I pressed the wrong input and installed too many things instead of just the relevant libraries. I was also worried that I had performed the installation wrong when it pulled up a default blog, thinking that I didn't fork the repo correctly. Instead I had done exactly what was needed--the existing blog posts were templates to show how Jekyll works! 

After this exercise, it's safe to say that I feel much more comfortable using Jekyll to make blog posts, and I look forward to learning more about its features and utilizations in the future!
